Laravel Livewire Dataview is a developer-focused toolkit for building SOLID-friendly data listing experiences in Livewire 3. It standardises how you configure queries, pagination and row rendering while keeping your components expressive and testable.

## What the package does

- Handles work that repeats on each Livewire component that shows items.
- Defines a way to automatically pass data to `item-views` like cards, lists, or table rows.
- Planned for next release:
  - Manage sorting data
  - Manage filters
  - Manage search

## What the package does not do

- The package is backend only. It does not define any frontend design for now.
